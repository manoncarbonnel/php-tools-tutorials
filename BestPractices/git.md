## Workflows

## Conventional commits

[Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) specification is a lightweight convention on top of commit messages. It provides an easy set of rules for creating an explicit commit history; which makes it easier to write automated tools on top of.
This convention dovetails with [SemVer](https://semver.org/)`, by describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.

Tell your users that you use the Conventional Commits specification: add this badge in the `README.md` file:

[Gitmoji](https://github.com/carloscuesta/gitmoji/) is an initiative to standardize and explain the use of emojis on GitHub commit messages.
Using emojis on commit messages provides an easy way of identifying the purpose or intention of a commit with only looking at the emojis used.

A [guide](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/) can help to use emojis easier.

Tell your users that you use the Gitmoji: add this badge in the `README.md` file:
